# Ringa AI™  

Welcome to **Ringa AI**, the future of AI agent development in decentralized ecosystems.  

## 🌟 About Us  
We are a team of passionate AI and Web3 innovators who left our roles at companies like Google AI, PayPal, Chainlink, and Bitkey to revolutionize how AI agents are built, deployed, and scaled in the blockchain era.  

Our mission is simple yet ambitious:  
- Empower developers and institutions with tools to seamlessly deploy and manage AI agents.  
- Create a platform where AI agents thrive in a decentralized, community-driven environment.  

## 🔗 Community-Driven Initiative  
Ringa AI is more than a project—it’s a movement. That’s why we’re launching **[pump.fun](http://pump.fun)**, giving our community the chance to own a piece of what we’re building.  

## 📅 What’s Next?  
- The $RINGA CA is dropping soon—stay tuned for updates.  
- All our developed code will be made public at launch to ensure transparency and trust.  

## 🌍 Est. 2025  
Born in San Francisco, California, we’re building for the future of AI and Web3.  

Let’s shape the future together! 🚀
